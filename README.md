# Invasion

You want to know your beloved country had done something shady in the past?
Just a mini fun project I've done for analysis purpose, although there isn't so much thing to analyze.

This image below show which countries had commited 'invasion' from 1700 onwards. Note that the nature of the invasion is out of picture, meaning that some invasions maybe a little less 'evil' than the others (i.e joining invasion as support, invading their own occupied region/counter invasion, etc.)

The data was scrapped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_invasions using the google sheet, imported to MySQL to find some insight like the occurrences of invasions for each nation (don't really need to use SQL to do this task tbh).

Usual suspects, UK/Great Britain/Britain/England appeared 45 times on list, followed by Russia/Soviet Union (37 times), United State (35 times) and France (34 times). Full visual shown below.
